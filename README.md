# DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS AND DEMO TO COME... FOR NOW JUST WANT TO GET THE CODE OUT TO FOLKS

# Quick Instructions

- Install Options
  - Copy the [raw code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitMurf/roam-javascript/master/filter-searching.js) from the filter-searching.js file in this GitHub repository.
  - Paste the code into your Web Browser dev tools console window and execute. (see [Chrome Demo Install](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-javascript/blob/master/README.md#manual-install-via-chrome-dev-tools-console--demo) below)
    - For easy "re-use" each time you load a new Roam tab you can use Chrome "snippets" (see [Saving JS as Chrome Snippet](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-javascript/blob/master/README.md#saving-as-code-snippet-in-chrome-for-easy-re-use) below)
  - OR use an extension like [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) to paste into and auto load the code each time you open a Roam browser tab/window.
- The code will stay active as long as you keep the current Roam browser tab open.
- Press either filter button (top of page or linked references) and a search box will open up next to the linked references filter.
- Uses the same search box for both filters.
- Daily Notes page
  - The Daily Notes page might act a little funky since multiple days load as you scroll down with multiple filters.
  - It will work but the search box will still be up on the current day so it will scroll you back up when filtering an older date.
- Remember with the new CSS functionality, you can move around my filter Search box if you prefer.
  - For example this code would move it to a fixed position up top near the page title (atleast on my theme).
  - You can customize however you need to make it work with your theme.
  - Code: `#fbSearchInput {position: fixed; left: 600px; top: 65px;}`
